\section{3 October 2024 - Lab equipment}

The goal of the first lab experience was to get to know the lab equipment and how it works. Below are two pictures (Fig. \ref{fig:01_instruments} and \ref{fig:01_cables}) of the available equipment during this experience. Three resistors (\SI{100}{ohm}, \SI{470}{ohm}, and \SI{1000}{ohm}) were also available and were used at the end of the experience.
